 The reason why I am interested in this is because heart failure is one of the top diseases that people die from specifically Latinos and african-americans. They are the ones with highest prevelance of heart failure. I want to use this data to understand what are solution that this can be prevent or explain the factors that are involved. 







 my ten questions about this data:
 1. how does it take account for race disparities?
 2. what are the correlations if there is any?
 3. how can this data be improved?
