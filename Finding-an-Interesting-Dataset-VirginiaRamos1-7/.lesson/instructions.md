  # Instructions  

Using Kaggle, find a dataset that you would like to explore and do an analysis of. Once you have found the dataset you want, upload the csv file here to your replit assignment. You will then download these files to vs code just like you did with our previous activity.

Once inside, use vscode to create a ".md" file that gives a brief explanation of why you chose this data set and lists out at least 10 questions about the dataset you hope to answer through your analysis. Once complete, commit your work to your github repository and submit your assignment on replit! 

NOTE : If you cannot find a dataset you fancy on Kaggle, it is alright to use another source to get the data. As long as you can find the data in a ".csv" format and the source can be trusted! (Wouldn't want you all out here using false / misrepresented data)

## Steps
No.| To Do
:-:|:-
1| Visit [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) to find a dataset that you would like to explore
2| Be thoughtful and considerate when looking over the datasets on Kaggle. You want to be mindful of the type of analysis you're doing, the types of questions you want to answer when choosing your dataset!
3| Once you have found the dataset of your dreams, download the dataset's csv file onto your computer. NOTE : Another thing to watch for when selecting a dataset is if the data is spread across multiple csv files. It is best for you all to try to keep to datasets where everything is in one place / file
4| Upload the csv file you downloaded here to your replit work folder
5| On line 6 of your "main.py" file, change the variable name to be more representative of the type of data you have and change the string within the function to match the name of the csv file you just uploaded
6| Download your replit work files to the folder you have in the documents on your computer, just like you did with the previous assignment.
7 | Rename your "main.py" file to reflect the type of data you have found. For example, if I am uploading a csv that is about pokemon, I would rename my file to something like "pokemon_data.py"
8| In your terminal, make sure you are in your root folder and install the following packages: pandas, jupyter notebook. NOTE : you can install packages using the command "python3 -m pip install {package name}" on a mac or using "py -m pip install {package name}" on a windows
9| Once you have the packages installed, you can open a jupyter notebook server on your computer by typing just "jupyter notebook" in your terminal. If that doesn't work, type "python3 -m jupyter notebook"(Mac) or "py -m jupyter notebook"(Windows) instead.
10| With jupyter open, go inside your new folder you just added to vscode, and then create a new Python 3 file using the new button to the right of the jupyter notebook interface
11| Name this notebook file and copy the code from you original python file into it. Remove the print statement at the bottom, but leave just the name of your data's variable. Using the button near the top that looks like a fast forward button, run the code. You should see your dataset print out!
12| Use the file option at the top of jupyter to save and checkpoint your work. Once you have, do a git commit to update your github repo with your new dataset!
13| Lastly, create a "README.md" file that briefly explains why you were interested in this data and what questions you hope to answer from your data analysis. Upload this to github as well once you finish.

  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```


  Include an image by placing it in the `assets` folder.

  For example, here is the Replit logo:
